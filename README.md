# Front End Developer Test

A simple test for front end developers. See notes / considerations for more info

## Setup

1. install using `npm install` or run `yarn`
2. run `gulp serve` to start 

## note / considerations

* This package uses an in-development (lightly tested) template builder that may cause a few oddities. The template builder 
is outside of the scope of this test, so shouldn't be looked at too closely.
* The compile gulp script builds all of the handlebars templates and sass files into the `dist` folder.
* In the event you can't see the site when running `gulp serve` or get a "not found" error, stop the `serve` task and run `gulp compile` first, OR 
simply open and save one of the partial handlebars files to recompile the site into the `dist` folder.
* This package was developed in the most rapid way possible. It's using the default Sass install and grid system that I use on a daily basis.
This is also to be deemed to be relatively out of scope as I'm likely to be using _your_ CSS preprocessor systems anyway.
* The build system does not currently support JS or image files - this is why I've chosen to use a CDN for the slider
* The slider I chose is not _quite_ right. The image sizes are responsive, ergo do not show the exact size as per the design. This is
something I would normally reconcile but have pushed to "backlog" given the time constraints.
* the grid system I've used is actually NOT very helpful in it's padding as it works it out by percentage instead of a fixed width. In retrospect,
I'd have much preferred a px based padding system - this has lined up the scroll gallery poorly.
* all git workings etc. can be seen on [my fork](https://github.com/BrenMurrell/fe-test)

## Original README.md contents

### Instructions

1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Set up a "static" project that includes a basic build system.
3. Develop a page based on the design using SCSS and a templating language of your choice.
4. If you are completing this test as part of a job application please include a zip file of your project (including git config/metadata) with your application otherwise create a pull request and we'll take a look :)

#### Guidelines

1. Your repo needs to include at minimum anything required to build the compiled HTML, CSS and JavaScript (where applicable).
   Detailed instructions should be provided in the `README.md` file to setup and run the app.
2. Use best practice.
3. Show us what you're capable of without using CSS frameworks such as foundation, bootstrap, etc.
4. Cross browser compatibility is important.
5. Try not spend too much time on it.

#### Bonus Points

* Use patterns like BEM, ITCSS
* Accessibility
* Consume dependencies with tools like Bower, NPM and RubyGems/Bundler
* Compile any assets with a build tool like gulp, webpack etc
* Unit and code quality tests
* Include a dev server
* Pay attention to the grid system
