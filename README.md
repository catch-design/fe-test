## Hello Catch!

Hi Murray, here is the completed test! I decided this was a great excuse to learn WebPack .. the morning before starting the project!
I was able to get to bundling JS and SCSS and running a live dev server which was been fun, though didn't quite manage to squeeze in file loading or HTML (yet).

Everything should be ready to roll, just cd to the 'app' project folder and 'npm run start' which should open up a dev server and load the project.

Cheers,
Gareth White.












# Front End Developer Test

A simple test for front end developers

## Instructions

1. Fork or clone this repo.
2. Set up a "static" project that includes a basic build system.
3. Develop a page based on the design using SCSS and a templating language of your choice.
4. If you are completing this test as part of a job application please include a zip file of your project (including git config/metadata) with your application otherwise create a pull request and we'll take a look :)

### Guidelines

1. Your repo needs to include at minimum anything required to build the compiled HTML, CSS and JavaScript (where applicable).
   Detailed instructions should be provided in the `README.md` file to setup and run the app.
2. Use best practice.
3. Show us what you're capable of without using CSS frameworks such as foundation, bootstrap, etc.
4. Cross browser compatibility is important.
5. Try not spend too much time on it.

### Bonus Points

* Use patterns like BEM, ITCSS
* Accessibility
* Consume dependencies with tools like Bower, NPM and RubyGems/Bundler
* Compile any assets with a build tool like gulp, webpack etc
* Unit and code quality tests
* Include a dev server
* Pay attention to the grid system
