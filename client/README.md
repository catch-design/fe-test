# Front End Developer Test

1. First, install dependencies

npm install

2. to run dev server, build dev version and start file watchers

npm start

3. to start production build (dist)

npm run build



some notes:

I thought it would be nice to create a working react app, instead of just templating files.

The form has validation build in, but only shows basic validation results, as in red borders around input when required fields are not filled or incorrectly and an enabled/ disabled submit button, there is still some room for improvement.

The button gallery at the bottom is scrollable so it would be a logical next step to add some dragging and animated interactions there.

For the rest I used a basic grid system, meaning that I only used column percentages that reflected the design.
